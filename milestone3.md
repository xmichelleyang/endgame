## Screenshots of updated UI
This iteration of the UI has a few changes. 
1. The navigation bar on the bottom is expanded to include all the functionalities. 
2. The texts are bigger and action buttons are made colorful for the convenience of the target users. The bigger texts are implemented because older people tend to have worse vision. The blue buttons signal attracts attention so the application is easy to navigate even for the less technologically fluent people. 
3. A new addition of the profile page
