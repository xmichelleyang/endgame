# Project Milestone 2

A skeleton for both your frontend and backend

### Updates

Our idea is largely similar to the one we proposed in Milestone 1, although we have decided to focus our application on a particular audience. We ultimately chose to cater our web application primarily towards elderly individuals, with the caretakers of the elder to be included as a stretch goal. This will impact our overall front-end architecture, as we aim to design our application in a format that is easily readable/accessible.
